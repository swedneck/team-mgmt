## Notes


### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgrade Release Process
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- @alanshaw - js-ipfs release process has been merged.
  - dogfooding this right now! feature freeze is in place! Alex is trying to automate the first few steps now
- @alanshaw - some tweeks to the go-ipfs release process have landed
  - open a new release issue when closing the previous one.
  - give an estimated release date.

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw

- Alan has reviewed the benchmarks PR

#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw

- Merged & tagged for release in js-ipfs@0.38.0

#### Gossipsub (js-libp2p)
@vasco-santos

- Decisions:
  - No longer experimental (defacto).
  - Enable by default (better UX, minimal impact)
  - Configured with Pubsub.Enabled (config value)
  - Flag will be deprecated and ignored.
- Merged & enabled by default in js-ipfs@0.38.0

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- applied suggested changes, PR ready for final review: [RFC 0001: Text Peer Ids as CIDs](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/209)

Please take a look if you are interested in peerIDs as CIDv1 and the new RFC process!

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Hit a roadblock with needing to update libp2p-switch dialing logic, related to [js-libp2p#451](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/451)
- Pausing on this to focus on js-libp2p async refactor work to get everything else unblocked.

#### IPNS (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann

- IPNS over PubSub
  - libp2p Discovery utilities needed to make things usable [go-libp2p#707](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/707)
  - 2 PRs out [libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery#26](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery/pull/26), [libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery#27](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery/pull/27)
  - Updated [libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery#184](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/184) to utilize latest changes, still needs a bit of work

- IPNS over DNS
  - Hammered out some details, @hugomrdias will be working on spec

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw/@auhau

#### Package Managers Updates
@dirkmc / @adin / @djdv

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc / @stebalien

* @stebalien - better connection tagging/management logic. It "does it's job" but I'll need help testing this in production.

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@alanshaw

* @alex - files added through async iterators
  - removed code!
  - faster than go! (sometimes)
  - ipfs.add(string)

Tracking issue: [js-ipfs#1670](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1670)

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- None

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- Bifrost/infra help on testing bitswap connmanager logic improvements
- Pinning issue: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6534
  - we aren't returning some pins we should - recent issue only in master
  - Adin will get a braindump on this later today!
  - Dirk volunteers to review

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

- do we have any IPC things for windows?
  - you can add a plugin on windows and make, but can't do dynamically on runtime
  - or use the http-api

### Parking Lot
